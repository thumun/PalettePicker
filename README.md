# finalproj.color

Purpose: 

    Create a color palette based on an image uploaded by the user 
        The site allows user to see the color before selecting/adding it to the palette (visible via 'hovered color')
        
        The site currently allows 5 colors in the palette 
            After 5 colors are selected, the user can select another color to clear the palette (but the latest selected color will be there)

Tools: 

    Upload button: 
        Where the user can upload an image file.
        
    Download button: 
        The user can download the palette in the form of a .txt file. This file gives the name, rgb value, hsl value, xyz value, and hexcode of each color.
    
    HSL Sliders: 
        These sliders allow the user to edit the image's hue, saturation, and/or lightness (brightness).
